**v2.0**

Updates from previous version:

- Created `project documentation` via `Doxygen` ;

- `Applied` a couple `Unit tests` for demonstration purposes. The `GoogleTest framework` was used ;

- Automatic `v1.5` project `deployment file` created .

**v1.5**

Updates from previous version:

- Created base class `person` and a derived class `student` .

**v1.2**

Updates from previous version:

- Expanded main class capabilities, initialized `"rule of five"` .

**v1.1**

Updates from previous version:

- `Applied classes` throughout the code (removed structs) ;

- `Performance analysis` of the program was `performed` with `std::vector` container and the `fastest strategy` :

*3rd strategy, std::vector container, -O3 flag (1.000.000 students):*

| Type / Time | Program   |
|-------------|-----------|
| *class*     | 6.1236323 |
| *struct*    | 5.6552146 |

*3rd strategy, std::vector container, -O3 flag (10.000.000 students):*

| Type / Time | Program   |
|-------------|-----------|
| *class*     | 61.342183 |
| *struct*    | 59.114327 |

- `Experimental analysis` was `performed` depending on compiler `optimization flags`:

*Optimization flags analysis (10.000.000 students):*

| Flag / Time | Program    | / .exe size |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
|             | 209.304579 | 215KB       |
| -O1         | 113.836258 | 145KB       |
| -O2         | 62.164601  | 118KB       |
| -O3         | 61.414359  | 118KB       |

**v1.0.1**

Updates from previous version:

- Strategy 3 has been added with the `specified algorithms` ;

*3rd strategy (10.000.000 students):*

| Type / Time   | Splitting |
|---------------|-----------|
| *std::deque*  | 0.700288  |
| *std::list*   | 3.86502   |
| *std::vector* | 0.845625  |

- The `3rd strategy` is `faster using std::vector` compared to the previous two .

**v1.0**

Splitting into two containers uses 2 new strategies:

- Strategy 1 creates `two` independent `containers` and splits students between them (memory consuming) ;

- Strategy 2 `reuses` the `main container` for unsuccessful students and `creates a single container` for successful students ;

*2nd strategy (10.000.000 students):*

| Type / Time   | Splitting |
|---------------|-----------|
| *std::deque*  | 0.273107  |
| *std::list*   | 1.88668   |
| *std::vector* | 2.16433   |

*1st strategy (10.000.000 students):*

| Type / Time   | Splitting |
|---------------|-----------|
| *std::deque*  | 0.954878  |
| *std::list*   | 3.99397   |
| *std::vector* | 2.75432   |

- The `2nd strategy` is more rational, since the program `performs faster` and consumes `2x less memory` .

**v0.5**

Performance analysis of the program was performed with `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::deque` containers:

- `Three` separate `programs` have been created with their `corresponding containers` ;

- Tested with my personal computer (`1,6 GHz` Dual-Core Intel Core `i5` / `8 GB` 1600 MHz DDR3 / 128 GB `SSD`) :

**v0.4**

Key functions have been developed such as:

- Random data `file generator` has been created ;

- The data is `sorted` into two categories (fail, when `final mark < 5`, pass, when `final mark >= 5`) when reading from file ;

- Sorted data is `outputted` into two `separate files` (fail.txt, pass.txt) ;

- `Performance analysis` of the program was `performed` with randomly generated data :
